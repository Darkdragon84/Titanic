# Titanic
Python scipts and notebooks playing around with the [Kaggle Titanic dataset ](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).  
The main focus so far is on a Neural Network binary classifier (even though this might not be the optimal classifier for this type of data), 
as a playground for building NN classifiers using Keras and hyperparameter tuning.


- Some exploration and feature engineering in notebooks/explore.ipynb
- KFold cross validaion in scripts/NN_classifier_CV.py
- Actual training on full training data and prediction on test data in scripts/NN_classifier.py
- Exploration of other classifiers in notebooks/Multiple_classifiers.ipynb (work in progress)
